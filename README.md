Hello,

This is the repo where I am keeping the initial code so that we can test out the seqvec embeddings.

I have written a simple script that reads the protein sequences to be embedded from a simple dictionary, embedding them using the Seqvec embedder, and storing them back in the dictionary, to then be stored in a JSON file to be used later.

The bio_embeddings code is taken directly from the original github: https://github.com/JhaKanchan15/PPI_GNN.git, specifically the seqvec_embedding.py file, if anyone needs to double check it.

Thank you for running this code and generating the file.
